        Step 2: Upload Content.
        Udemy students love being hands-on with their learning: they want to practice what they've learned through exercises, activities, case studies, and more! There are lots of different types of practice activities you can add to your course to help create an engaging online learning experience.

        Step 3: QuickLook on contents.
        When showing files in your website on the courses created, including the ability to quickly preview a file and its content can be helpful to your users. For example, you may want to allow users to zoom into a photo, play back an audio file, and so on. Use the QuickLook framework to show a preview of common file types in your app that allow basic interactions. QuickLook can generate previews for common file types.
